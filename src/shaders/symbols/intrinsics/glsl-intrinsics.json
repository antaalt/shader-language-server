The noise function is a stochastic function that can be used to increase visual complexity. Values returned by the noise functions give the appearance of randomness, but are not truly random. They are defined to have the following characteristics:The return value(s) are always in the range [-1.0,1.0], and cover at least the range [-0.6, 0.6], with a Gaussian-like distribution. The return value(s) have an overall average of 0.0. They are repeatable, in that a particular input value will always produce the same return value. They are statistically invariant under rotation (i.e., no matter how the domain is rotated, it has the same statistical character). They have a statistical invariance under translation (i.e., no matter how the domain is translated, it has the same statistical character). They typically give different results under translation.
